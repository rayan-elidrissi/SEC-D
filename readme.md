A hackathon prototype introducing the <strong>SEC-D Score</strong>: a new environmental responsibility metric for cloud infrastructure.
</p>

---

## 🚀 Overview

**GreenCloud** is a mockup platform built during a sustainability-focused hackathon to highlight the importance of eco-responsible cloud services.

At its core is the **SEC-D Score** - a new environmental metric (kg CO₂eq per GB) that evaluates cloud service sustainability across compute, storage, and hosting. GreenCloud introduces a vision for the cloud of the future: carbon-aware, transparent, and user-driven.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- 🏭 The cloud industry generates **significant carbon emissions**, yet most users are unaware of the ecological impact of their service choices.
- 📉 The **SEC-D Score** empowers consumers and businesses to compare cloud offerings based on **carbon efficiency** and **renewable energy usage**.
- 🏆 Designed to support **EU environmental goals for 2030 & 2040**, driving awareness and accountability.

## 📊 The SEC-D Score

> **SEC-D** = Sustainability of Energy Consumption per Data  
> (kg CO₂eq / GB of service usage)

| Use Case | SEC-D Score | Grade |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Green Cloud Storage | 0.08 kg CO₂eq/GB | A+ |
| Eco Virtual Machines | 0.20 kg CO₂eq/GB | B |
| Green Compute | 0.55 kg CO₂eq/GB | C |

These values are mock estimates based on energy sourcing, compression efficiency, and cooling strategies.
